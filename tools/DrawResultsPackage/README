DrawPdfs

program usage:
DrawPdfs [options] dir1[:label1] [dir2:[label2]] [...]

First directory is used as reference for PDF ratio plots
and to display data in data pulls plots.
Directory labels are used in the legends of the plots, to add spaces and
special characters to the labels use quotation marks '' (ex. dir:'HERA I').
To specify greek letters and latex commands in the labels use the ROOT notation
(#alpha #bar{u}).
It is possible to specify up to 6 directories, you need to specify at least one directory.

general options:
	 --help
	 	 Show this help
	 --pdf (require ps2pdf)
	 	 Produce and addition plot file in pdf format
	 --colorpattern <1-3>
	 	 Select among 3 additional color patterns
	 --lowres
		 Low resolution plots (smaller file)
	 --highres
		 High resolution plots (paper quality)
options for pdf plots:
	 --bands
	 	 Draw PDF uncertainty band
	 --asymbands
	 	 PDF bands are not symmetrised
	 --outdir <output directory>
	 	 Specify output directory
	 --splitplots
	 	 Produce also additional eps files for each plot
	 --filledbands
	 	 Filled uncertainty bands, usefull for sensitivity studies
	 --ratiorange min:max
	 	 Specify y axis range in PDF ratio plots
	 --xrange min:max
	 	 Specify x axis range in PDF plots: minimum x is 0.0001, maximum x is 1
	  --xrange min:max
   	    	 Specify x axis range in PDF plots,
		 default minimum and maximum x are determined by settings
		 in the first reference directory
	 --no-logx
	 	 Linear x scale in PDF plots
options for data pulls plots:
	 --therr
		 Plot theory errors if availables
  	 --points
		 Plot theory as displaced marker points (with vertical error bars) instead of continous lines (with dashed error area)
	 to set axis titles, axis range and log scales add PlotDesc options in the data file
	 Example:
	 &PlotDesc
	    PlotN = 1
	    PlotDefColumn = 'y2'
	    PlotDefValue = 0., 5.
	    PlotOptions(1)  = 'XTitle: y_{Z} [GeV/c] @YTitle: d#sigma/dy_{Z} [pb]  @Xmin:0.0@Xmax:2.5@Ylog'

DrawResults

program usage:
DrawResults --exp <exp_dir> --model <model_dir> --param <param_dir> <basedir>

Options can be used in any order. Directory after the option is refered as corresponding directory
for this option. Directory without the option before it is refered as a base directory.
Experimental and model uncertainties are calculated as square root of sum of uncertainties from
corresponding sources in quadrature. In case of parametrization uncertainty for each bin the
bigest up and down deviations among the sources are taken.

directories:
	<exp_dir> - path to experimental uncertainty variations.
	<model_dir> - path to merged model uncertainty variations.
	<param_dir> - path to merged parametrization uncertainty variations.
	<basedir> - path to the central fit results.

To prepare merged model (parametrization) uncertainty directory:
  1. Create a parent directory for model (parametrization) uncertainty variations.
  2. Create a separate directory for each of your variations. Put "p" and "m" in the end of plus and
minus variations directories respectively (in case of parametrization this is not needed, use any names).
Fill the directories with the fit results of your variations.
  3. Copy script trunk/tools/DrawResultsPackage/mergeModel.sh (trunk/tools/DrawResultsPackage/mergeParam.sh)
to your model (parametrization) uncertainty parent directory. Next change the script in the following way:

		mergeModel.sh				mergeParam.sh

PARAMNAMES	name of the directories			name of the directories
		with your model uncertainty		with your parametrization
		variations without last			uncertainty variations.
		character.

PARAMVARS	last characters in the			-
		directories names
		(by default "m" and "p"),
		coresponding to plus and
		minus variations.

Q2NBINS		number of Q^2 bins in your fits		number of Q^2 bins in your fits.

DIRBASE		path to the directory with		path to the directory with
		central fit results.			central fit results.

  4. Change access permissions for mergeModel.sh (mergeParam.sh) to make it executable and run it. The "summ"
directory should be created. If the script doesn`t run, try:

	bash mergeModel.sh
	(bash mergeParam.sh)

  5. Use created "summ" directory as your merged model (parametrization) uncertainty directory.
