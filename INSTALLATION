                 Installation and Usage Instructions


0) Pre-requirements.
====================

-- QCDNUM version at least qcdnum-17-00/04, can be found at 
  http://mbotje.web.cern.ch/mbotje/qcdnum/Site/QCDNUM17.html

-- CERNLIB. Note that for CERNLIB one can use /afs/ installation from CERN:
  /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/cernlib/

-- Link to recent Root libraries (e.g. version 5.26)

-- Optional: APPLGRID

-- HERAfitter has been tested on various platforms: 
   SL4, SL5 (32 and 64 bit),  Ubuntu 10.10, MacOXS

1) INSTALLATION (basic installation)
====================================

  a) Specify CERN_ROOT and QCDNUM_ROOT environment variables such that 
     $CERN_ROOT/lib  and $QCDNUM_ROOT/lib point to the corresponding libraries
     ( e.g. export CERN_ROOT=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/cernlib/2006a/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt)

  b) Run:

    ./configure
    make 
    make install

    --> you should get bin/FitPDF executable file installed

  c) Run a check

    bin/FitPDF 

  d) Storing of the outputs: output/ (default, name can be changed in the steering.txt)
	- minuit.out.txt  			(minuit output)
	- Results.txt 				(chiquare and the systematic shifts)
	- lhapdf.block.txt			(ready to use LHAPDF style grids, run tools/tolhapdf.cmd)
	- fittedresults.txt			(theory predictions for each fitted data point)
	- pulls.first/last.txt		(pulls at the start and end of the fit)
	- pdfs_q2val_0i.txt, i=1, user defined (PDF sets at predefined Q2 values, as set in the steering.txt)	


1B) INSTALLATION (with APPLGRID)
=================================

  a) Specify CERN_ROOT and QCDNUM_ROOT variables such that 
     $CERN_ROOT/lib  and $QCDNUM_ROOT/lib point to the corresponding libraries

     Install APPLGRID version 1.1.6 or later. Description can be found at
         http://projects.hepforge.org/applgrid/

  b) Run:

    ./configure --enable-applgrid
    make 
    make install

    --> you should get bin/FitPDF executable file installed

  c) Run a check

    bin/FitPDF 


1C) INSTALLATION (with Hathor)
=================================

  a) Download Hathor version 1.5 from http://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/pep/tools/hathor.html
     and install it according to the instructions given there
     (requires LHAPDF library)

  b) Define a variable HATHOR_ROOT such that $HATHOR_ROOT points to the
     directory of your Hathor installation

  c) Install the HERAFitter as described above but configuring it
     with the option "--enable-hathor" before building it

    ./configure --enable-hathor
    make 
    make install


1D) INSTALLATION with LHAPDF 
============================================
  a) include lhapdf-config in your PATH variable
	(e.g. export PATH=/your/path/to/lhapdf/bin)
  b) include libLHAPDF.so library in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
	(e.g. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path/to/lhapdf/lib)
  c) enable the lhapdf in the configure: ./configure --enable-lhapdf

The lhapdf will be used if you change  PDFStyle = 'LHAPDF' in the steering card.

    ./configure --enable-lhapdf
    make 
    make install


1E) INSTALLATION with NNPDF reweighting tool
============================================
	- needs linking to LHAPDF 
	README located in ./NNPDF directory


    ./configure --enable-lhapdf --enable-nnpdf
    make 
    make install

1F) Modules such as 
 - DIPOLE
 - DiffDIS (Diffractive DIS)  
 - DY (LO)
 - heavy flavour schemes RT, ACOT, ABM 

can be ran with simple INSTALLATION procedure as described above.
Their activation is possible through the input steerings in the 
steering.txt (use appropriate cards stored in input_steering/!)

1F) INSTALLATION for TMD(updf)
============================================
	- needs linking to CASCADE & PYTHIA 
	- needs linking to LHAPDF 
	README located in ./Cascade directory
      
  a) set environment variables:
  
    export CERN_ROOT=/cern/pro 
    export QCDNUM_ROOT=/h1wgs/h1desy11/x04/usr/glazov/openfitter/qcdnum-17-00-03
    export CASCADE_ROOT=/afs/desy.de/group/alliance/mcg/public/MCGenerators/cascade/2.2.04/$SYSNAME
    export PYTHIA_ROOT=/afs/desy.de/group/alliance/mcg/public/MCGenerators/pythia6/425/$SYSNAME

  b) Run:

   ./configure --enable-updf --enable-lhapdf --enable-checkBounds
    make 
    make install

    --> you should get bin/FitPDF executable file installed

  c) Run a check

    bin/FitPDF
