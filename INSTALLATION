                 Installation and Usage Instructions

0) Pre-requirements.
====================

-- QCDNUM version at least qcdnum-17-01/11, can be found at 
   http://www.nikhef.nl/~h24/qcdnum/QcdnumDownload.html

-- Link to recent Root libraries (e.g. version 5.34)

-- xFitter has been tested on various platforms: 
   SL4, SL5, SL6 (32 and 64 bit), Ubuntu 10.10-14.04, MacOXS

-- Optional: APPLgrid, LHAPDF, APFEL, MELA

1) INSTALLATION (basic installation)
====================================

  a) Run:

    ./configure (--prefix=/your/installation/path/)
    make 
    make install

  b) make sure that "/your/installation/path/bin" is in your PATH.
    --> you should get "xfitter" executable file installed.

  c) Run a check from the source folder:

    xfitter

  d) Storing of the outputs: output/ (default, name can be changed in the steering.txt)
	- minuit.out.txt  			(minuit output)
	- Results.txt 				(chiquare and the systematic shifts)
	- lhapdf.block.txt			(ready to use LHAPDF5.X style grids, run tools/tolhapdf.cmd)
	- hf_pdf		          	(directory with the ready to use LHAPDF6.X style grids)
	- fittedresults.txt			(theory predictions for each fitted data point)
	- pulls.first/last.txt		(pulls at the start and end of the fit)
	- pdfs_q2val_0i.txt			(user defined PDF sets at predefined Q2 values, as set in the steering.txt)	

1B) INSTALLATION (with APPLgrid)
=================================

  a) Install APPLgrid version 1.4.56 or later. Description can be found at
     http://projects.hepforge.org/applgrid/

  b) Run:

    ./configure --enable-applgrid (--prefix=/your/installation/path/)
    make 
    make install

  c) make sure that "/your/installation/path/bin" is in your PATH.
    --> you should get "xfitter" executable file installed.

  d) Run a check from the source folder:

    xfitter

1C) INSTALLATION (with Hathor)
=================================

  a) Download Hathor version 1.5 from http://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/pep/tools/hathor.html
     and install it according to the instructions given there
     (requires LHAPDF library)
     NOTE: Hathor versions above 1.5 are not supported to work with xFitter 

  b) Define a variable HATHOR_ROOT such that $HATHOR_ROOT points to the
     directory of your Hathor installation

  c) Install the xFitter as described above but configuring it
     with the option "--enable-hathor" before building it

    ./configure --enable-hathor (--prefix=/your/installation/path/)
    make 
    make install

1D) INSTALLATION with LHAPDF (v5 or 6)
============================================

  a) include lhapdf-config in your PATH variable
	(e.g. export PATH=/your/path/to/lhapdf/bin)
  b) include libLHAPDF.so library in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
	(e.g. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path/to/lhapdf/lib)
  c) enable the lhapdf in the configure: ./configure --enable-lhapdf

The lhapdf will be used if you change  PDFStyle = 'LHAPDF' in the steering card.

    ./configure --enable-lhapdf (--prefix=/your/installation/path/)
    make
    make install

1E) INSTALLATION with NNPDF reweighting tool
============================================
	- needs linking to LHAPDF 
	README located in ./NNPDF directory

    ./configure --enable-lhapdf --enable-nnpdf (--prefix=/your/installation/path/)
    make 
    make install

NOTE: reweighting currently is working with LHAPDF6.1.1 or higher versions only

1F) Modules such as 
 - DIPOLE
 - DiffDIS (Diffractive DIS)  
 - DY (LO)
 - ttbar with DiffTop
 - heavy flavour schemes RT, ACOT, ABM 

can be ran with simple INSTALLATION procedure as described above.
Their activation is possible through the input steerings in the 
steering.txt (use appropriate cards stored in input_steering/!)


1F) INSTALLATION for TMD(updf)
============================================
	- needs linking to CASCADE & PYTHIA 
	- needs linking to LHAPDF 
      
  a) set environment variables:
   
    for example (with SYSNAME=x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt or similar):
    export PYTHIA_ROOT=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/MCGenerators/pythia6/428.2/$SYSNAME
    export CASCADE_ROOT=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/MCGenerators/cascade/2.2.04/$SYSNAME
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PYTHIA_ROOT/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CASCADE_ROOT/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  b) Run:

   ./configure --enable-updf --enable-lhapdf --enable-checkBounds (--prefix=/your/installation/path/)
    make 
    make install

    --> you should get "xfitter" executable file installed

  c) Run a check

    xfitter
