                     HERAFITTER  ---  PDF fit program from HERA
                 DiffDIS package for the diffractive PDF fit to DIS 
               ------------------------------------------------------

General description
====================

Diffractive DIS data are fitted within the 'proton vertex factorisation' approach where 
the diffractive DIS is mediated by the exchange of hard Pomeron and a secondary Reggeon.
The model was used in previous HERA fits, see e.g.
1. ZEUS Collaboration, S. Chekanov, et al., Nucl. Phys. B 831 (2010) 1.
2. H1 Collaboration, A. Aktas, et al., Eur. Phys. J. C 48 (2006) 715.

The model supplied by the DiffDIS package provides values of the 'reduced cross section',
sigma_r = F2 - y^2/(1+(1-y)^2) FL
which is expected to be the experimentally meausured quantity.
(Actually, the ZEUS data files ZEUS-LPS_2009.dat and ZEUS-LRG_2009.dat contain xPom*sigma_r.)
The structure functions F2 and FL are calculated at NLO with heavy quarks treated according to the Thorn-Roberts GM-VFNS.

Relevant formulae and notation can be found in the above mentioned papers and in the attached diffit.pdf file.
The Eqs. numbers in the following correspond to the latter.

F2 and FL are calculated from DPDFs given by Eq. (18). The Reggeon PDFs, f^R are taken as those of GRV pion.
The fluxes are given by Eqs. (9,10) and they require following parameters, defined in plug_DDIS.h:
  Flux_tmin, Flux_tmax -- t limits for the integrated flux
  Pomeron_tslope -- Pomeron flux t-slope (b)
  Pomeron_a0 -- Pomeron intercept
  Pomeron_a1 -- Pomeron slope
  Reggeon_tslope -- Reggeon flux t-slope (b)
  Reggeon_a0 -- Reggeon intercept
  Reggeon_a1 -- Reggeon slope
  Reggeon_factor -- A_R of Eq. (10a)
The values of these parameters are predefined in plug_DDIS.h and can also be read from the DDIS.coca file.
A_P of Eq. (10a) is set to 1 --- it is absorbed into the initial Pomeron parametrization, Eq. (19).

Example run
============

This example reproduces the ZEUS-C fit results of Ref. [1].

Here the fitted parameters include:
 -- A_i of Eq. (19) for the gluon and light quarks --- they correspond to Ag, Bg, Cg and Auv, Buv, Cuv of the minuit.in.txt file,
 -- Pomeron_a0, Reggeon_a0 and Reggeon_factor --- they are declared and initialized in the 'ExtraMinimisationParameters' section of the steering.txt file.
In order to reproduce the original results the ewparam.txt file is modified to contain the appropriate heavy quark masses.

The three above mentioned files are stored as
input_steering/minuit.in.txt.DIFFRACTION
input_steering/steerig.txt.DIFFRACTION
input_steering/ewparam.txt.DIFFRACTION
and must be copied to minuit.in.txt, steerig.txt and ewparam.txt, respectively, before running the program.
