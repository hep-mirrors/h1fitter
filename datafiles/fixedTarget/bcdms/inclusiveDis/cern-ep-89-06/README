*Data measured at 100, 120, 200 and 280 GeV beam energy
*The columns are: x, Q^2, inelastisity Y, reduced c.s.=F_2*(1-Y....,
*uncorrelated error, the number of syst. errors, correlated errors (all
*errors in percent):
*  due to the beam momentum calibration, due to the spectrometer magnetic
*field calibration, uncertainty in the spectrometer resolution,
*uncertainty in the detector and trigger inefficiencies, uncertainty in
*the relative normalization of data from external and internal targets,
*the absolute normalization of the data taken at the beam energy of 200
*GeV, the relative normalization of the data taken at other energies 
*(100, 120, and 280 GeV).
* the last column corresponds to 1.3sigma systematic shift due to the 
*beam energy or spectrometer resolution.
