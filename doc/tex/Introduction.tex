%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This manual provides a short description of the \fitter\ program 
which can be used to determine unpolarised parton density functions 
(PDFs) using deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data and other processes such as 
Drell-Yan, jet or ttbar processes.
The parton density functions are needed to calculate cross sections
for the $ep$ and $pp$ colliders and thus required for interpetation
of the data collected at the LHC.
% The \fitter\ program were used to determine the HERA1.0 PDF set~\cite{h1zeus:2009wt}.

The manual begins with program installation instructions for different scenarios (section~\ref{sec:install}), followed by a brief discussion of the theoretical calculation
used in the program (section~\ref{sec:theory}) continued by a description of the
PDF parameterisation (section~\ref{sec:pdfparam}) and various $\chi^2$ functions used in the
minimisation (section~\ref{sec:chi2}). A description of the program steering cards and
the output options is given in section~\ref{sec:man}.
