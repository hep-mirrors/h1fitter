The PDF uncertainties can be estimated using a Monte Carlo technique \cite{mcmethod}.
The method consists in preparing replicas of data sets by allowing the central values of the cross sections to 
fluctuate within their systematic and statistical uncertainties taking into account all point-to-point correlations.
The preparation of the data is repeated for a large $N$ ($>100$ times) and for each of these replicas a NLO QCD fit is performed to 
extract the PDF set. The PDF central values and uncertainties are estimated using the means values and RMS 
over the replicas.
