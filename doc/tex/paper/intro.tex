This paper provides a comprehensive description of  \\
the \fitter\ package,
which is designed for analysis of the High Energy Physics data.
The package has been developed by members of the H1 and ZEUS collaborations
with an exclusive support of different theoretical groups.
The main purpose of the \fitter\ package is analysis of the 
data from the $e^{\pm}p$, $p\bar{p}$, and $pp$ collider experiments
%information obtained from the deep inelastic scattering experiments
and the determination of the parton density functions (PDFs).
%The broad range of data taken from the $e^{\pm}p$, $p\bar{p}$, and $pp$ collider experiments can be
%studied by the package. 

The outline of this paper is as follows.
A brief discussion of the theoretical calculation
used in the program (section~\ref{sec:theory}) is followed by description of the 
methodology of determining PDF  based on various ansatz and  $\chi^2$ definitions used in the
minimisation (section~\ref{sec:method}). Specific applications of the package are given in
section ~\ref{sec:examples}.
