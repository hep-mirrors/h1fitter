\fitter is an open source code and it can be downloaded from the dedicated webpage \cite{herafitter:page}
together with its supporting documentation and 
% A README file is provided within the package together with the 
fast grid theory files (described in section \ref{sec:techniques}) associated with the properly formatted data files available in \fitter.
The source code contains all the relevant information to perform QCD fits with HERA DIS data as a default 
set~\footnote{Default settings in \fitter are tuned to reproduce the central HERAPDF1.0 set.}. 
The performance time depends on the fitting options and varies from 10 minutes 
(using 'FAST' techniques as described in section \ref{sec:techniques}) to several hours when full uncertainties are estimated. The \fitter code is a combination of C++ and Fortran 77 libraries with minimal 
dependencies, i.e. for the default fitting options no external dependences are required except \qcdnum evolution program \cite{qcdnum} and CERN libraries. 
The \tt ROOT \rm  libaries are only required for the drawing tools and when invoking \applgrid\rm.  
There are also cache options, fast evolution kernels, and usage of the OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing)  interface which allows parallel applications of the GM-VFNS theory predictions in DIS. 
In addition, the \fitter references and GNU public licence are provided 
together with the main source code.
