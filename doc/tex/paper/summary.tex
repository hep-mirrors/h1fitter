\label{sec:summary}
The \fitter project is a unique platform for QCD analyses to study the 
structure of the proton.
The project successfully encapsulates a wide variety
of QCD tools to facilitate analyses of the experimental data
and theoretical calculations. \fitter is the first open source platform which is optimal for benchmarking studies. It allows for direct comparisons of various theoretical approaches under the same settings, a variety of different methodologies in treating of the experimental and model uncertainties. The growth of \fitter is driven by the QCD advances in theoretical calculations and in precision of experimental data.
%  and it benefits from a flexible and modular structure of the software package.
