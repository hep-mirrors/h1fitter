The \fitter project is a unique framework for QCD analyses to study the proton 
structure which incorporates the most of the experimental data processes from hadron
colliders sensitive to PDFs and variety of the up-to date theory calculations. 
It has flexible modular structure and contains many different useful tools for PDF interpretation. 
\fitter is the first open source platform optimal for various benchmarking studies
and is excessively used by various experimental and theoretical high energy physics
communities.
