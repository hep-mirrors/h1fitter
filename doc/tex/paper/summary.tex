The \fitter project is a unique platform for QCD analyses to study the 
structure of the proton.
The project successfully encapsulates a wide variety
of QCD tools to facilitate investigations of the experimental data
and theoretical calculations. \fitter is the first open source platform which is optimal for benchmarking studies. It allows for direct comparisons of various theoretical approaches under the same settings, a variety of different methodologies in treating of the experimental and model uncertainties. The growth of \fitter benefits from its flexible modular structure driven by QCD advances.
