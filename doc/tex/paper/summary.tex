\label{sec:summary}
\fitter is an open-source platform designed to study the structure of the proton.
It provides unique and flexible framework with a wide variety of QCD tools to 
facilitate analyses of the experimental data and theoretical calculations. 
\fitter allows for direct comparisons of various theoretical approaches under the same settings, 
different methodologies in treating the experimental and model uncertainties and can be used for benchmarking studies.
The growth of \fitter is driven by the latest QCD advances in theoretical calculations and in precision of experimental data.
