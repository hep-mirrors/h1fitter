The \fitter project is a unique platform for QCD analyses to study the 
structure of the proton. It incorporates not only the crucial data on
Deep Inelastic Scattering from HERA but also data from the hadron colliders 
which are sensitive to Parton Distribution Functions. A variety of up-to-date 
theory calculations are available for each process at LO, NLO and NNLO 
when possible.  
\fitter has flexible modular structure and contains many different useful tools for PDF interpretation. 
\fitter is the first open source platform which is optimal for benchmarking studies.
%and is extensively used by the experimental and theoretical high energy physics
%communities.
