The \fitter project is a unique platform for QCD analyses to study the 
structure of the proton.
It incorporates relevant data on
Deep Inelastic Scattering from HERA as well as data from the hadron colliders 
which are sensitive to Parton Distribution Functions. 
\fitter provides variety of up-to-date theory calculations for
LO, NLO and NNLO predictions and fast minimization tools.
\fitter has flexible modular structure and contains many different useful tools for PDF interpretation. 
\fitter is the first open source platform which is optimal for benchmarking studies.
%and is extensively used by the experimental and theoretical high energy physics
%communities.
