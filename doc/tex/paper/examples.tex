\fitter has been successfully integrated in the high energy community as a much needed mean in providing understanding and interpretation of new measurements in context of QCD theory, in a field which is currently limitted by the PDF uncertainty.  
The applicability of the \fitter platform is reflected in usage and extraction of the theory parameters from data such as PDFs, strong coupling, heavy quark masses, quantitative asssessment of the fit quality with full detail information in provided experimental and theoretical uncertainties.
Importantly, it also produces PDF grids that could be used further for an improved and more discriminating powers of predictions for beyond SM processes, as well as for impact studies of possible future colliders using pseudo-data.

The series of PDF grids extracted so far extend from the QCD analyses performed at HERA (HERAPDF series \cite{HERAPDFs}), now extented to the LHC with published measurements from ATLAS (the first ever ATLAS PDF sets \cite{ATLASgrids}).
% to the QCD studies performed using pseudo-data to study the potential of possible future collider design such as LHeC.

A list of new results that have been based on \fitter  platform includes the SM processes studied at the LHC in inclusive  $W$and $Z$ production, in inclusive jets, and also extended to the top measurements (which benefit from recent theoretical advancements).
