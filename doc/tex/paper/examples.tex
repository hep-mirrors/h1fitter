\fitter has been successfully integrated in the high energy community as a much needed mean in providing understanding and interpretation of new measurements in context of QCD theory, a field limitted by the PDF precision.  
The applicability of the \fitter platform is reflected in usage and extraction of the theory parameters from data such as PDFs, strong coupling, heavy quark masses, quantitative asssessment of the fit quality with full detail information in provided experimental and theoretical uncertainties.
Importantly, it also produces PDF grids that could be used further for an improved and more discriminating powers of predictions for beyond SM processes, as well as for impact studies of possible future colliders using pseudo-data.

The series of PDF grids extracted so far extend from the QCD analyses performed at 
HERA (HERAPDF series~\cite{h1zeus:2009wt}), now extented to the LHC with published 
measurements from ATLAS~\cite{atlas:strange} (the first ever ATLAS PDF sets~\cite{atlas:grids}).
% to the QCD studies performed using pseudo-data to study the potential of possible future collider design such as LHeC.

A list of new results that have been based on \fitter platform includes the SM processes 
studied at the LHC in inclusive $W$and $Z$ production~\cite{atlas:strange,atlas:hm,cms:strange},
in inclusive jets~\cite{atlas:jets,cms:jets}, and also extended 
to the top measurements (which benefit from recent theoretical advancements).
At HERA, the results of QCD analyses using \fitter are published in inclusive H1 measurements~\cite{h1:2012kk}
and the recent combination of charm production measurements in DIS~\cite{h1zeus:charm}.
The \fitter framework also provides an unique possibility to make impact studies for future colliders
which can be illustrated by the preformed QCD studies exploring the potential of the LHeC data~\cite{lhec:studies}.
