The \fitter program was used in a number of experimental and theoretical analyses. 
This list includes several LHC analyses of SM processes, namely
%The \fitter package was used for the following LHC analyses of SM processes:
%New results that have been based on the \fitter platform include 
%the following SM processes 
%studied at the LHC:  
inclusive Drell-Yan and $W$and $Z$ production~\cite{atlas:strange,cms:strange,atlas:hm,Aad:2014qja,Aad:2014xca},
inclusive jet production \cite{atlas:jets}.

The results of QCD analyses using \fitter were also
published by HERA experiments in the inclusive \cite{h1zeus:2009wt,h1:2012kk} and
the heavy flavour production measurements \cite{h1zeus:charm, Abramowicz:2014zub}.
Following theory and phenomenology studies were performed with \fitter:
a determination of the transverse momentum dependent gluon density using precision HERA data \cite{Hautmann:2013tba}, 
an analysis of HERA data within a dipole model \cite{Luszczak:2013rxa},
the study of the low-x uncertainties in PDFs determined from the HERA data using 
different parametrisations \cite{Chebyshev} and the impact of QED radiative corrections on PDFs \cite{Sadykov:2014aua}.
A recent study based on a set of PDFs determined with the \fitter and addressing 
the correlated uncertainties between orders was published in \cite{hfcorrpaper}. 
%
%was performed~\cite{hfcorrpaper}. It addresses the issue of correlations between uncertainties for the LO,
%NLO and NNLO PDF sets. These sets are then propagated to study uncertainties 
%for ratios of cross sections calculated at different orders in QCD and  
%a reduction of overall theoretical uncertainty is observed in a mixed NLO/NNLO ratio compared to 
%a NLO/NLO ratio due to the reduced scale uncertainty of the NNLO calculation.

The \fitter framework has been used to produce PDF grids from the QCD analyses performed at 
HERA \cite{h1zeus:2009wt,hera:grids} and at the LHC \cite{atlas:grids}, using 
measurements from ATLAS~\cite{atlas:strange,atlas:jets}, which can be used to study predictions for SM 
or beyond SM processes. Moreover, \fitter provides a possibility to perform various benchmarking exercises
\cite{Butterworth:2014efa} and impact studies for possible future colliders
as demonstrated by the QCD studies at the LHeC~\cite{lhec:studies}.
