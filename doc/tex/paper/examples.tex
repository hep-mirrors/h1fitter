The application of \fitter consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Description of product of the \fitter in terms of PDFGrids: HERA, LHC, LHeC.
\item
Application of \fitter in the QCD interpretation of data: \\
- at HERA  \\
- at LHC (WZ, DY, jets..)  \\
- possibility to make impact studies for future colliders.
\end{itemize}
