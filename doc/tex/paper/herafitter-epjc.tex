\begin{abstract}
The \fitter project is presented 
which provides a framework for Quantum Chronodynamics (QCD) analyses related 
to the proton structure in the context of multi-processes and multi-experiments.
Based on the concept of factorisable nature of the cross sections into universal parton distribution functions (PDFs) and process dependent partonic scattering cross sections, \fitter allows determination of PDFs from the various hard scattering measurements.
%or obtaining benchmark 
%{\bf (olaf is the benchmarking part of HERAFItter or not?
%If not then take it out here)} 
%predictions for such processes using different
%PDFs. 
The main processes and data sets that are currently included
are Deep-Inelastic-Scattering (DIS) 
in $ep$ collisions at HERA and Drell Yan (DY), jet and top quark production in 
$pp$ ($p\bar{p}$) collisions at the LHC (Tevatron).
A large number of theoretical and methodological options is
available within \fitter via interfaces to external software packages.
%The determination of the  proton patron distribution functions is a complex 
%endeavor involving several physics processes. The main process is deep-inelastic 
%scattering and the central  data set covering most of the proton structure 
%phase space is provided at the HERA ep collider. Further processes 
%(fixed target DIS, ppbar collisions etc.) provide further constraints for 
%particular aspects: flavor separation, very high Bjorken-x etc.
%In particular, the precise measurements obtained or to come from LHC will 
%continue to improve the knowledge of the PDF. 
%The HERAFitter project aim at providing a framework for QCD analyses related 
%to proton structure in the context of multi-processes and multi-experiments. 
%The framework includes modules or interfaces enabling a large number of 
%theoretical and methodological options, as well as a large number of 
%relevant data sets from HERA, Tevatron and LHC. 
%This manual explains the theoretical input used in the QCD analysis, 
%the fit  methodology and the  installation procedure of the program. 
%More information and the package downloads can be found on the web 
%site {\tt http://herafitter.org}.
