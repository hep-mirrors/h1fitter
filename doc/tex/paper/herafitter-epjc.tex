\begin{abstract}
\fitter \cite{herafitter:page} is an open-source package
which provides a framework for the determination of the
parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton and for
multifold analyses in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

Measurements of lepton-proton deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
and of proton-proton (proton-antiproton) collisions
at hadron colliders are included in the \fitter package,
and are used to probe and constrain
the partonic content of the proton.

The partonic distributions are determined by using 
the factorisation properties of the hadronic cross sections 
in which short-distance perturbatively calculable hard scatterings      
and long-distance contributions that are the non-perturbative universal PDFs,
are factorised.

The \fitter platform provides a broad choice of options             
for the treatment of the experimental uncertainties and a common
environment where a large number of theoretical calculations and
methodological options are used to perform detailed QCD analyses.
The general structure of \fitter together with available methods
are described in this paper.

%The paper presents the \fitter package \cite{herafitter:page}
%which provides a framework for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) analyses related 
%to the proton structure.
%%in the context of multi-processes and multi-experiments.
%The main processes sensitive to the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) 
%of the proton are Deep-Inelastic-Scattering (DIS) 
%in $ep$ collisions at HERA and Drell-Yan (DY), jet and top quark production in 
%$pp$ ($p\bar{p}$) collisions at the LHC (Tevatron).
%Data of recent measurements are included into \fitter and can 
%be used for PDF determination
% based on the concept of the factorisable nature 
%of the cross sections of hard scattering measurements into process dependent 
%partonic scattering and universal PDFs.
%\fitter provides a comprehensive choice of options in the treatment of the experimental 
%data uncertainties, a large number of theoretical and methodological options 
%through interfaces to external software packages which are described here.
