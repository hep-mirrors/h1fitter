The \fitter\ program uses DGLAP~\cite{Gribov:1972ri,Gribov:1972rt,Lipatov:1974qm,Dokshitzer:1977sg,Altarelli:1977zs}
 evolution 
equations as implemented in the QCDNUM~\cite{qcdnum} program. The fit 
procedure begins with parameterising the input PDFs at the starting 
scale $Q^2_0$ which should be chosen to be below the charm mass threshold
$m_C^2$.
The PDFs are then evolved using the DGLAP evolution equations  
at NLO~\cite{Curci:1980uw,Furmanski:1980cm} in the $\overline{MS}$ scheme.
The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to $Q^2$. The \fitter\ program
also allows for LO and NNLO evolution. 

The cross-section predictions are obtain by convoluting the PDFS with the 
coefficient functions. For the DIS processes, those are calculated 
using the general mass variable-flavour scheme. 
The program implements the  zero mass scheme from QCDNUM as well as
the RT scheme~\cite{Thorne:1997ga,Thorne:2006qt}. The jet cross sections
are calculated using APPLGRID and FastNLO. The program has two implementations
for $pp$  DY processes. The first implementation uses
calculations at LO which can be extended to NLO using k-factors,
the second uses the APPLGRID interface.
